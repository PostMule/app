# PostMule — Session Handoff

**On restart, say:** "Resume PostMule work from HANDOFF.md"

Session 2026-06-10: Designed the autopilot deployment harness — `.claude/autopilot/PLAN.md` v1→v4.1 (phase state machine, gates, recovery, red-team amendments, private ops repo, model policy). Status: draft, owner has since approved proceeding. Session ended prematurely (unplanned OS restart) after final commit `4b26219` — all work was pushed; only the conversation was lost.

## Next

> Check `gh issue list --repo PostMule/app` for current state before starting.
> Do not suggest or offer to work on blocked or deferred issues — only note they exist.

**Recommended:** Deploy the autopilot harness per `.claude/autopilot/PLAN.md` §10 build order (owner approved 2026-06-10). After P0, the first P1 task is the Fable-tier MVP/overengineering critical review of PostMule itself.

**Previously recommended (now queued for the autopilot):** Continue #102 chunk 3 — polish and close. Remaining work: (a) test the wizard end-to-end against a real Gmail + Gemini account to confirm no edge cases, (b) close #101 (setup.ps1 Gemini regex bug — superseded by the wizard), (c) close #102 if wizard is feature-complete. Also check if step 4 (master password) needs a tester or if it's fine as-is (no external service to test).

**After #102:** Build #104 — Expert Directory. Run the bootstrapping session using `.claude/skills/Expert-framework-prompt.md`. Start with `frontend_developer` and `ux_designer`. Produces `.claude/experts/EXPERT_DIRECTORY.md`.

**In progress:** Live validation (#30) — PostMule installed and running at C:\Users\openclaw0123\PostMule. Dry runs pass clean. Next step: trigger a real run once a VPM scan notification email arrives.

**Other open issues (blocked):**
- #103 — logs test fails on machines with live install (pre-existing; easy fix)
- #101 — setup.ps1 Gemini regex bug (will be closed when #102 is built)
- #97 — Cloud deployment investigation (owner must decide platform/cost tradeoffs first)
- #96 — Installer validation (unblocked once #102 is done)
- #93 — VPM API confirmation (requires live VPM account)
- #91 — Configure DNS for postmule.com (manual registrar step)
- #87 — Vectorize logo (requires designer/Illustrator)

**Pending (not a code task):** Push a `v*` tag (e.g. `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`) to trigger the first release. After that, update README Option A to link to the Releases page instead of "coming soon".
