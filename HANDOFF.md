Session 2026-06-11 (autopilot, second run): re-checked — same result as the prior run. `approved/mvp-scope` still does not exist on origin, so per PLAN §14.16 the only phase-1 task allowed is `p1-fix-103`, already `done`. The 7 gate-1 tasks and `p1-await-mvp-scope` remain pending but not pickable. No recovery branches on origin. No code or STATE.json changes this run.

**Recommended:** Run the owner-attended MVP scoping review (#105, spec: ops PLAN §14.16) in a Fable session. It gates the entire P1 backlog; approve its verdict table with the `approved/mvp-scope` tag. The autopilot handles everything else on schedule — owner contract is reading the pinned "Autopilot Dashboard" issue in PostMule/ops weekly.

**Previously recommended (now queued for the autopilot):** Continue #102 chunk 3 — polish and close. Remaining work: (a) test the wizard end-to-end against a real Gmail + Gemini account to confirm no edge cases, (b) close #101 (setup.ps1 Gemini regex bug — superseded by the wizard), (c) close #102 if wizard is feature-complete. Also check if step 4 (master password) needs a tester or if it's fine as-is (no external service to test).

**After #102:** Build #104 — Expert Directory. Run the bootstrapping session using `.claude/skills/Expert-framework-prompt.md`. Start with `frontend_developer` and `ux_designer`. Produces `.claude/experts/EXPERT_DIRECTORY.md`.

**In progress:** Live validation (#30) — PostMule installed and running at C:\Users\openclaw0123\PostMule. Dry runs pass clean. Next step: trigger a real run once a VPM scan notification email arrives.

**Other open issues (blocked):**
- #101 — setup.ps1 Gemini regex bug (will be closed when #102 is built)
- #97 — Cloud deployment investigation (owner must decide platform/cost tradeoffs first)
- #96 — Installer validation (unblocked once #102 is done)
- #93 — VPM API confirmation (requires live VPM account)
- #91 — Configure DNS for postmule.com (manual registrar step)
- #87 — Vectorize logo (requires designer/Illustrator)

**Pending (not a code task):** Push a `v*` tag (e.g. `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`) to trigger the first release. After that, update README Option A to link to the Releases page instead of "coming soon".
