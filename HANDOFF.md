Session 2026-06-22 (autopilot, mode=normal, phase=1): empty backlog (owner-38/owner-39 both done in prior runs), so ran the phase-1 gate `gate-1-code-green.ps1`. Verdict FAIL (exit 1); regenerated `telemetry/quality-report.md` (ops, only the timestamp changed — quality state unchanged from prior run) and stopped per charter Step 2 — findings live in that report, not the queue. This is now the third consecutive gate-only no-op run: every failing bar is owner-gated, so the autopilot cannot advance without an owner session. Failing bars all known/expected: coverage 74.29% (<80% floor; alignment proposal `ops/proposals/gate-1-coverage-floor.md`), ruff whole-tree errors (gate runs `ruff check .` incl. tests/scripts; `postmule/`-only is clean), bandit Low only (0 High/Medium, but the gate's exit-code check trips on any), pip-audit (msgpack + pip, deferred), and 8 open app issues lacking an allowlist label (#107/#104/#97/#96/#93/#91/#87/#30 — owner allowlist decision). The mypy gate false-positive recurred again: gate flagged `mypy.exe not clean` while direct `mypy postmule` exits 0 and quality-report records mypy=0 — confirmed on a third run, isolated to the gate's own mypy invocation (ops #47). Step 1.3: clean tree, up to date with origin, no `autopilot/recovery-*` branches present this run. The uncommitted ops #44/#45 cage implementation flagged in prior runs was not re-checked (out of scope for a gate-only run; still owner-gated per ops #44). No app-repo code changes this run. No permission denials.

## Next

> Check `gh issue list --repo PostMule/app` for current state before starting.
> Do not suggest or offer to work on blocked or deferred issues — only note they exist.

**Cross-platform decision (2026-06-12):** owner committed to making PostMule run on Windows and macOS, and to rewriting the harness in Python per the template. Build plan: ops `PLAN.md` §16 (two tracks: A = PostMule itself OS-agnostic, scoped by #105; B = Python harness in ops `harness/`, deferred past v0.1.0 per the MVP review). Track B step 1 (the dependency-free Python core, 55 tests) stays as already-built; the PowerShell harness in ops `scripts/` is frozen and ships v0.1.0.

**P1 queue:** No pending owner-intake tasks remain — `owner-38` done this run, `owner-39` done last run. The next normal-mode run with an empty backlog will run the phase-1 gate script and regenerate the quality report (the gate findings live in `telemetry/quality-report.md`, not the queue). App quality state unchanged: ruff clean (postmule/), mypy 0 errors, bandit 0 Medium/High, coverage 74.29%, pytest 1055 passed.

**Blocked (needs owner action before next autopilot run can advance):**
- `p1-self-audit` (needs-owner): Complete implementation is at `ops/proposals/p1-self-audit-implementation.md` — requires owner session to apply governed files (`scripts/self-audit.ps1`, `scripts/watchdog.ps1` patch, `governance-baseline.lock` regen, `COMMANDS.md`).
- `p1-ocr-tesseract` (needs-owner): OCR per-OS Tesseract detection and clear error messaging.
- pip 26.0.1 CVEs (3 remaining): pip cannot self-upgrade via `pip install -r requirements.txt`; deferred until safe-pip.ps1 targets the venv Python. All other runtime CVEs cleared.
- Gate-1 coverage floor: the ops gate script still requires ≥80%; proposal to align it with the measured 74% floor is at `ops/proposals/gate-1-coverage-floor.md`.

**Recommended (owner-attended):** Run the pre-P1 product premortem from `mvp-review.md` section 3 — a focused `council-this` session scoped to runtime/operational failure modes (cloud-LLM dependency, token cost, pipeline runtime failures), not a re-run of the 2026-04-04 architecture council. This sits beside the P1 queue, not inside it.

**In progress:** Live validation (#30) — PostMule installed and running at C:\Users\openclaw0123\PostMule. Dry runs pass clean. Next step: trigger a real run once a VPM scan notification email arrives.

**Other open issues (blocked or post-release):**
- #104 — Expert Directory (unblocked backlog work, not in the P1 queue; pick up post-v0.1.0 or as a gap-fill)
- #101 — setup.ps1 Gemini regex bug (superseded by the #102 wizard)
- #97 — Cloud deployment investigation (owner must decide platform/cost tradeoffs first)
- #96 — Installer validation (blocked on the macOS install contract, future P1 task)
- #93 — VPM API confirmation (requires live VPM account)
- #91 — Configure DNS for postmule.com (manual registrar step)
- #87 — Vectorize logo (requires designer/Illustrator)

**Pending (not a code task):** Push a `v*` tag (e.g. `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`) to trigger the first release. After that, update README Option A to link to the Releases page instead of "coming soon".
